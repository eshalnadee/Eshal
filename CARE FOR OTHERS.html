  <p><b>BULLING</b> a common situation every student has to deal with even though the victim is innocent.Every one was
    bullied as a kid and got embarassed too but it was'nt so intense as it is today.Mostly when people see some one
    getting picked on they usually run or hide to save them selves but we should not do that.Instead of running away
    stand up and go embarasse the bully other wise every single kid including you is going to get in serious trouble.

    much(People with disabillities) are made fun of the most.</p>
